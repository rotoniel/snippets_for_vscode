# Snippets for VSCode
The use of snippets to accelerate code writing is implemented in VSCode, but the engine doesn't support automatic triggering of the snippets. HyperSnips is a extension by draivin that allows such functionality. This is a very personal implementation of the snippets that I use in my work. For the moment, mainly latex. 
Feel free to use them if they make sense to you.
